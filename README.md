# Ideas Repository

A system for managing project ideas and automatically generating structured tickets with implementation plans.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository helps you:

2. **Generate Tickets**: Automatically convert ideas into detailed project tickets

## 📁 Structure

```
├── ideas/              # Store your project ideas here
├── tickets/            # Auto-generated project tickets
├── templates/          # Templates for ideas and tickets
├── scripts/            # Automation scripts

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create a New Idea

Copy the template and fill it out:
```bash
cp templates/idea-template.md ideas/idea-my-project.md
# Edit the file with your project details
```

### 2. Generate a Ticket

Convert a single idea to a ticket:
```bash
python3 scripts/ideas_to_tickets.py ideas/idea-my-project.md
```

Or convert all ideas at once:
```bash
./scripts/convert_all_ideas.sh
```

### 3. Review Your Ticket

Check the generated ticket in the `tickets/` directory. It will include:
- Structured project overview
- Implementation phases
- Acceptance criteria
- Technology recommendations

- **Headline**: Brief, catchy description
- **Category**: Type of project (Web App, Mobile, CLI, etc.)
- **Description**: Detailed explanation

- **Complexity**: Time estimate
- **Similar Projects**: References for inspiration

## 🎫 Generated Tickets

Auto-generated tickets include:
