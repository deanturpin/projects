**Generated from idea:** `ticket-code-collaboration`  
**Date:** 2025-09-17  
**Category:** Web Application

## Overview
A web-based platform that allows developers to collaborate on code in real-time, similar to Google Docs but specifically designed for programming. Features include syntax highlighting, code execution, version control integration, and voice/video chat.

## Goals
- [ ] Create responsive user interface
- [ ] Implement backend API
- [ ] Deploy to production environment

## Target Audience
Software development teams, coding bootcamps, pair programming sessions, remote developers.

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
TypeScript, React, Node.js, Socket.io for real-time features, Monaco Editor, Docker for code execution, WebRTC for video chat.

### Estimated Complexity
Complex (3+ months)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Project setup and initial structure
- [ ] Core dependencies and configuration
- [ ] Basic architecture design

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Implement main functionality
- [ ] Basic user interface/API
- [ ] Core business logic

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Testing and quality assurance
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Production setup
- [ ] Deployment pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring and maintenance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project meets functional requirements
- [ ] Code is well-documented and tested
- [ ] Performance meets expected benchmarks
- [ ] User experience is intuitive and responsive

## Resources
- Similar projects: CodePen, Replit, CodeSandbox, VS Code Live Share
- Documentation links: [To be added]
- Design assets: [To be added]

## Notes
Security is crucial for code execution. Need to implement proper sandboxing. Could integrate with GitHub/GitLab for seamless workflow.
